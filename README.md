# RasPiVision
Java vision Raspberry Pi example

### To Run
To run download the Vision.jar and Vision.mp4 make sure these are in the same directory. It will then open a window.

This particular program ran on a raspberry pi running with raspbian zero which is command line only. This was to leave space for the OpenCV library. Instead of taking a .mp4 as an input it would instead connect to the stream of the IP camera on our robot. It would then return values over the raspberry pi's GPIO pins back to the main controller on the robot.
